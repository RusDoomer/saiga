# Saiga
```

```

Lots of inrolls, right pinky is low usage, but may have higher than preferred movement, most SFBs are `LT` on right middle, `RN` on the left index, and the vowel block. Some people may have issue with `GCW` pinky.

If bearable though, I recommend moving `e` to the pinky:

# Saiga-E
```
; o u r q f d l b w
e a i n x y h t s c '
/ . , j z k p m v g
```

Significantly more inrolls in exchange for `e` on pinky. Also now the left middle is lower usage but has some interesting sfbs and sfs.

Some possible swaps:
- If you need the layout to be 3x10 swap `/` for `'`
- If you need lower LSBs on the right hand and don't mind scissors swap `f` and `v`. This also increases SFBs, Skip 1 and Skip 2 bigrams slightly.
- On Saiga-E swap `;` and `j` for more inrolls in exchange for `JE` SFB (infrequent).
- If you swap `;` and `j` you may also consider swapping `z` and `;` for slightly less LSB.
- You may also swap `g` and `w`, this increases same row inrolls, in exchange for more scissor skipgrams.

## Other variants

# Krai - more extreme in search of same row inrolls
```
j o u r q v d l b g
e a i n x y h t s c '
/ . , ; z k p m f w
```
(krai-old had `gw` swapped)

# Mir - a compromise between Krai and Saiga-E
```
j o u r q f d l b g
e a i n x y h t s c '
/ . , z ; k p m v w
```

Some notes on my choices:
- I wanted more inrolls
- I wanted more same row inrolls
- I dislike SL ring
- I designed these with colstag in mind
